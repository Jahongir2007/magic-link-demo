This is little real usage example demo for creating passwordless logins with magic link.
### 🌐 Demo Goal

A small full-stack example:
 - Frontend form → user types their email
 - Backend → sends a magic link using `auth-verify`
 - Clicking the link → verifies user and shows success page

### ⚡ Run Demo
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Then open http://localhost:3000

Enter your email — you’ll get a magic link.
Click it → you’re verified 🎉
